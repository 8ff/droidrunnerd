1. Go to the Chats tab (not Updates, Communities, or Calls)
2. Look for chats that need a reply - these are chats where the last message is on the LEFT side (messages from others). Messages on the RIGHT side in green are ones we sent.
3. For each chat needing a reply:
   - Open the chat
   - Read recent messages to understand context
   - Send an appropriate reply
   - Go back to chat list
4. Skip chats where the last message is on the right (we already replied)
5. Return to home desktop when done.
6. Report which chats you replied to and what you said
